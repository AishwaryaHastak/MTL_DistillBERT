"A Portela Mencia 2013, Spain, A Portela Mencia 2013, Spain, Dark purple. Powerful aromas of candied blackberry, blueberry and licorice, complicated by violet and cracked pepper. Lush, intensely flavored and smooth, offering spicy dark berry and cherry compote flavors enlivened by a subtle floral nuance. Finishes sappy and long, with resonating spiciness, a hint of licorice and chewy tannins."
"Adami Garbel Brut Prosecco, Prosecco, Italy, Adami Garbel Brut Prosecco, Prosecco, Italy, Garbèl, which in ancient local dialect means adry, crisp, pleasantly tart wine, is produced from the hilly vineyards in the Colli Trevigiani area. The ample nose releases crisp-edged, complexfruit notes, and the palate is full-flavored with a crisp acidity. A wonderfully versatile sparkler, Garbèl's 13 grams of residual sugar place it between the Brut and Extra Dry styles, making it perfect for wine bars as well as celebrations."
