"Keenan's 2015 Chardonnay shows citrus, ripe pear and green apple in the nose. Hints of lush white peach are noticed as the wine opens up. The sur-lie aging has added richness and complexity, and a touch of toasty oak returns on the finish. Like all of Keenanâ€™s wines, this Chardonnay is a food worthy wine whose crisp acidity and medium body will accompany a wide variety of cuisine."

"This dense purple-colored Shiraz is full-bodied with powerful lifted aromas, well-integrated oak, and rich ripe berry fruit flavors. It is a style that can be enjoyed as a relatively young wine or bottle aged to develop classic regional characters and added complexity - recommended cellaring time 6-8 years in ideal storage conditions. "

"Luminous pink-orange hue. Fine mousse. Nose of ripe red fruit, black cherry, strawberry. Smooth and fresh palate (Meunier), red fruit, blackberry, cherry, finesse of Chardonnay (one-third), hint of lemon in the finish."
